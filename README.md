# Sign-Up Form with Split Image Layout

This project is a simple responsive sign-up page featuring a two-column layout:  
- Left side: a full-height background image  
- Right side: a vertical layout with a header, a multi-field form arranged in rows with two label-input pairs per row, and a footer containing the submit button  

Built with semantic HTML and CSS Flexbox for clean, flexible alignment. The form labels are stacked above inputs for clarity, and the layout fills the viewport height for a balanced design.
